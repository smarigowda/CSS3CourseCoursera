    <h2>This's my name</h2>
    <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico.<br>It's cooler
      than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the
      residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
    <p class="important">Sorry, we have no slow lorries here.</p>
    <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
    <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text</p>
    <h2 class="emphasized">Some people italisize and bold too much</h2>
    <p>I <em>really</em> feel that some writers use <i>way</i> too much <span class="emphasized">bold</span> and an <strong>incredible amount</strong> of italics when thay could use <b>far fewer</b> of these text effects.</p>
    <p>This is going to be a <span class="standout">red letter day</span></p>
